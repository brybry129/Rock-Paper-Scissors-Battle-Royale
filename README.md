# Rock Paper Scissors Battle Royale
*In Progress*

This is a fun project I wanted to try my hand at recreating after seeing a video of it on social media. It simulates a battle royale between rocks, papers, and scissors. Built in Python using the Turtle module.

## Dependencies
```sh
pip install PythonTurtle
```

## Usage
After running the program enter in the number of competitors then simple sit back and watch the chaos unfold.
